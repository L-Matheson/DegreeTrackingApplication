   "course_block": "ANT 280 - Prehistoric Art\nThis course takes a combined anthropological, historical, and critical approach and focuses on two case studies: 1) the Palaeolithic (Ice Age) art of Eurasia (ca. 32,400-10,000 years ago); and 2) the pre-colonial rock art of southern Africa (prior to 1652 AD). It reviews the diversity of forms and activities constituting prehistoric image making, and their numerous interpretations, including: “art for art’s sake,” magico-religion, structuralism, neo-evolutionary functionalism, and shamanism. It also considers the sociopolitical climate within which these theories have been proposed and identifies problematic assumptions and biases. The term “prehistoric art” is a major topic of discussion as students evaluate the relevance, appropriateness, and limitations of a western (European) definition of “art” for understanding non-Western image making.\nPrerequisite(s):\nCo-requisite(s):\nCredits: 3\nMeets the Following Core Requirement: Cultural Interpretation; International\nCourse Typically Offered:\nCourse Type: Anthropology"
