Macroeconomics studies some of society’s biggest issues by examining how the economy as a whole operates. How can we improve the standard of living in our country and around the world? Why aren’t there always enough jobs to employ everyone who is willing and able to work? How can the government implement economic policy to limit unemployment, curtail inflation, and generally improve lives? These are some of the important questions that this course will address. Students will learn monetary and fiscal policy, international trade and globalization, the business cycle, competing theories of the government’s role in the economy, poverty, and inequality. Students will explore a variety of perspectives by examining theoretical concepts, modeling economic relationships, and discussing real-world issues.\nPrerequisite(s):\nCo-requisite(s):\nCredits: 3\nMeets the Following Core Requirement: Quantitative Reasoning; Socio-cultural Analysis\nCourse Typically Offered: Fall, spring, and summer\nCourse Type: Economics"
