The social meanings given to bodies, sexuality, procreation, parenting, and work extend beyond notions of identity, interpersonal relationships, sexuality, and households. Gender also involves economics, government, religion, politics, science, technology, war, and globalization. This course rests on the premise that sex and gender are both “culturally constructed” and explores how gendered practices and beliefs serve as “systems” of differentiation. The “politics of difference” is explored across a variety of Western and non-Western cultures.\nPrerequisite(s):\nCo-requisite(s):\nCredits: 3\nMeets the Following Core Requirement: Culture, Power, and Equity; International; Socio-cultural Analysis\nCourse Typically Offered:\nCourse Type: Anthropology"

Students will examine language-teaching approaches and what it takes to understand the language itself in a non-technical but accurate way for accessible and effective teaching.
