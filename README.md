# Description
This backend is constructed through the Django framework and will host the data around which the degree tracking application will be built.

For help installing the API, see https://github.com/L-Matheson/DegreeTrackingApplication/wiki/Installation

This capstone project aims to develop a better environment for students to track their degree progression as they progress through their college careers. Currently, the process
is more tedious than it needs to be and often leaves students unsure if they are on the right track to meet their goals. This API looks to fix these issues by presenting a user-friendly 
experience to easily display all of a student's required classes in one location. This API will be fully customizable so it can be modified depending on a student's graduation or education 
goals. 


# Use
As mentioned, this API runs on a Django framework. This utilizes the REST framework which allows the API to use routes such as GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. The directory is set up so the backend is all 
stored inside the api folder, with the frontend stored inside of frontend. There are some files outside of these folders. Their purpose is to build the docker containers and volumes, along with other 
nessacery Django settings. 

To better understand how to use the API after installation, please refer to the wiki at https://github.com/L-Matheson/DegreeTrackingApplication/wiki/Degree-Tracking-Usage
