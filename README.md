# Description
This backend is constructed through the Django framework and will host the data around which the degree tracking application will be built. 

This capstone project aims to develop a better environment for students to track their degree progression as they progress through their college careers. Currently, the process
is more tedious than it needs to be and often leaves students unsure if they are on the right track to meet their goals. This API looks to fix these issues by presenting a user-friendly 
experience to easily display all of a student's required classes in one location. This API will be fully customizable so it can be modified depending on a student's graduation or education 
goals. 

Some of the expected key features of this API are
  * See what classes to take each semester to reach graduation by a student-selected year
  * Allow for these classes to be changed and have the API adapt to the change to still display a timeline properly
  * Display an overview of all required classes, including core and degree-specific
  * TBD
